# Glaucoma_Detection
"Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques" focuses on the development of an intelligent diagnostic tool designed to detect glaucoma from retinal fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Glaucoma, a group of eye conditions leading to optic nerve damage and potential blindness, often progresses without early symptoms, making timely detection critical. The proposed system addresses this challenge by leveraging a custom CNN model trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising 4218 retinal images categorized into four classes: normal, cataract, diabetic, and glaucomatous. Unlike existing models that rely on pre-trained architectures like Inception V3, DenseNet121, and ResNet50, this project introduces a tailored CNN architecture that demonstrated superior accuracy of 96%, outperforming earlier models. The system utilizes key deep learning components such as convolutional and pooling layers, dropout for overfitting reduction, and a softmax-based output layer to classify images effectively. Through rigorous data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, the project showcases the potential of deep learning in medical imaging, offering a scalable and automated solution that aids clinicians in early diagnosis and management of glaucoma, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.
